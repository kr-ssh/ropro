very original roblox extension yes

### how to install the thing
universal settings:
- you can't install this if you already have ropro
- yes it works on other chrome-based/firefox-based (older versions might not work) browsers just lookup "how to debug extensions on [chrome-based/firefox-   based browser]" 
- yes it works on mac, windows and linux it's an extension not software
- no i can't publish this as an extension in any webstore because i'd get a cease and desist letter up my ass

for chrome:
- install the src and unzip it
- go to: chrome://extensions
- click "load unpacked"
- add the folder or manifest.json file for the pop-up
- done

for firefox:
- install the src and unzip it
